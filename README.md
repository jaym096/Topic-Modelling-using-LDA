# Topic-Modelling-using-LDA
This is an academic project done in the course **CSCI-B55 Machine Learning** at Indiana University.

In this project I used **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** with Gibbs Sampling o infere topic distribution within the corpus and word distribution per topic. Evaluate the dimensionality reduction capability of LDA to support document classification and compared it with the bag of words representation.

The project consists of 3 code file (.py):\
main.py, supporting_func.py, glm.py

The folders 20newsgroups and artificial contains all the data set. The code considers that the data folder(20newsgroups) is in the same 
directory as the code.
