# Topic-Modelling-using-LDA
This is an academic project done in the course CSCI-B55 Machine Learning at Indiana University.

In this project I used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with Gibbs Sampling o infere topic distribution within the corpus and word distribution per topic. Evaluate the dimensionality reduction capability of LDA to support document classification and compared it with the bag of words representation.

Note: Information to run the code is available in **Info.txt**
