# Topic-Modelling-using-LDA
This is an academic project done in the course **CSCI-B55 Machine Learning** at Indiana University.
**Tools and Technology used:** Python, NumPy

In this project I used **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** with **Gibbs Sampling** to infere topic distribution within the corpus and word distribution per topic. Evaluate the dimensionality reduction capability of LDA to support document classification and compared it with the bag of words representation.

The project consists of 3 code file (.py):\
_main.py_, _supporting_func.py_, _glm.py_

The folders _20newsgroups_ and _artificial_ contains all the data set. The code considers that the data folder is in the same directory as the code. 

## HOW TO RUN THE CODE
     1. To run the code you only use the main.py file
     2. To run the program, you should do the following (Example):
        python3 main.py
